# MCIPs
Multi-chain Improvement Proposals

## Rationale
It is hard to get a proposal in the EIP repo. You must know people and have connection. It takes a lot of times, despite if your proposal is pure genius or totally stupid.

This repo is for the rest of us. Is a place where you can propose an improvement, ideally applyable on multiple chains, like it was in the early days of the Ethereum community. As long as an idea has enough attention and discussions, the author can make a PR to add it in the list below.

## Proposals

[MCIP-1 Cross-Player on-chain NFT Attributes](https://github.com/ndujaLabs/erc721playable)

[MCIP-2 NFT cross-chain contract addresses](https://github.com/ndujaLabs/MCIPs/blob/main/MCIPs/mcip-2.md)

[MCIP-3 NFT stakeable w/out losing ownership](https://github.com/ndujaLabs/MCIPs/blob/main/MCIPs/mcip-3.md)
